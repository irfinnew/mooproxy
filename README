  1. About
  --------

Mooproxy is a layer between your MOO client and a MOO server, as shown below:

    MOO client  <---->  Mooproxy  <---->  MOO server

The intention is that the proxy remains connected to the server, even if
you disconnect your MOO client, for example, if you shutdown your computer,
take your laptop to a different place, or have network problems.

Mooproxy also provides centralised logging, which is useful if you use
multiple MOO clients.

Mooproxy is still under development; bug reports and other feedback is
appreciated. If you really want to help, run it in valgrind (with 
--leak-check=full and --show-reachable=yes), and report any crashes or
memleaks you get (Please report the full valgrind output, and the version
of mooproxy you're using).

gdb backtraces of crashes are also helpful.



  2. Manual compiling and installing
  ----------------------------------

First, you can edit the Makefile to change some options (like installation
path and compiler flags), if you want to.

Next, to compile mooproxy, simply run

    make

in the source directory. You need a working C compiler, and the development
libraries for libc. Mooproxy also uses some functionality that may not be
present on all Unices; see Portability.

You can install by running

   make install

This will install the mooproxy binary (by default in /usr/local/bin), and
the manpage (by default in /usr/local/share/man/man1).
Alternatively, you can install by simply copying the mooproxy executable
to a suitable place, such as /usr/local/bin or ~/bin. Mooproxy requires no
other files (except configuration files) to run.




  3. Installing the Debian package
  --------------------------------

Currently, an i386 Debian package is provided. You can install it with

  dpkg -i mooproxy_<version>.deb



  4. Creating a Debian package
  ----------------------------

You can create your own Debian package as well (for another architecture,
for example). Follow the following steps:

  - Download mooproxy-debsrc-<version>.tar.gz
  - Unpack it somewhere
  - cd into mooproxy-<version>
  - Unpack mooproxy_<version>.orig.tar.gz
  - Run zcat mooproxy_<version>.diff.gz | patch -p0
  - cd into mooproxy-<version>
  - Run dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -rfakeroot

The Debian package (and some other files) will be generated in the top-level
mooproxy-<version> directory.



  5. Using
  --------

Running mooproxy is simple, just invoke it like this:

    mooproxy -w <wld>

where <wld> is the name of the world. Mooproxy will use the configuration
file ~/.mooproxy/worlds/<wld> . See the file ExampleConfig for an example
configuration file. The ExampleConfig file contains all configurable
options, and the settings in ExampleConfig are exactly the same as the
builtin defaults in mooproxy.

Note: currently, mooproxy cannot run as a daemon in the background. If you
want it to run in the background, use nohup and &, or screen.

Mooproxy accepts commands to change a lot of its behaviour run-time.
When connected to mooproxy, do /help for a brief list of commands.



  6. Authentication
  -----------------

There are two situations in mooproxy that require authentication;

  - A MOO client connects to mooproxy
  - Mooproxy connects to a MOO server

Mooproxy uses the same authentication string for both. In the configuration
file for the world, you should put a MD5 hash of the authentication string.
When the client connects to mooproxy, the client or the user supplies the
authentication string to mooproxy. Mooproxy hashes the authentication
string from the client, compares it to the stored MD5 hash, and if they
match, the client is accepted.

At this point, mooproxy stores the _literal_ authentication string received
from the client in its memory. When mooproxy logs in to the server (for
example, because autologin is enabled), mooproxy uses this literal
authentication string to authenticate itself to the MOO server.

The MD5 hash can be created with the following command:

    mooproxy --md5crypt


An example scenario. Assume:

    The MOO server expects:     connect <username> <password>
    Your MOO client generates:  connect Gandalf Shire

Now, run the following command:

    mooproxy --md5crypt

When mooproxy asks for your authentication string (it will ask twice, to
save you from typo's), you should enter:

    connect Gandalf Shire

Mooproxy will print a MD5 hash of the string, e.g.:

    $1$DWuIlrlu$vjiUiV7i23jNMCpSkDzDz.

You put this string in your configuration file, like so:

    auth_md5hash = "$1$DWuIlrlu$vjiUiV7i23jNMCpSkDzDz."

Now, when your client connects to mooproxy, it is prompted for the
authentication string. If your client responds with:

    connect Gandalf Shire

Mooproxy will accept the client, and store "connect Gandalf Shire" in its
memory. Now, when mooproxy connects to the MOO server, and autologin is
enabled, mooproxy sends the saved string, namely

    connect Gandalf Shire

to the MOO server, logging you in, just like your MOO client would without
mooproxy in the middle.


To change the authentication string from within mooproxy, you must also
provide the old literal authentication string, like this:

    /set auth_md5hash <new hash> <old literal>

So, continuing the example scenario above, if you change your password to
"Mirkwood", you must run mooproxy --md5crypt to generate a MD5 hash of the
new authentication string:

    $ mooproxy --md5crypt
    Authentication string: connect Gandalf Mirkwood
    MD5 hash: $1$PzGmXA.I$qmZomnNK2gBW6tR8iTJLA/

You can then set the new hash like this:

    /set auth_md5hash $1$PzGmXA.I$qmZomnNK2gBW6tR8iTJLA/ "connect Gandalf Shire"

The MD5 hash should not be enclosed in quotes. It is recommended to enclose
the old literal in quotes, to remove ambiguity. After changing auth_md5hash
from within mooproxy, mooproxy no longer has a literal authentication string.
Therefore, autologin will not work until you re-authenticate to mooproxy
(for example, by disconnecting your client, and connecting again).



  7. Portability
  --------------

Mooproxy is designed to run on modern Unices, most notably GNU/Linux and
the open source BSD variants. Mooproxy is written in ANSI C, using mostly
POSIX-defined systemcalls. This section documents the additional requirements
for mooproxy.

As of this writing, mooproxy is tested on Debian Unstable with Linux 2.6,
and FreeBSD 5.4.

Portability pitfalls:

 * Mooproxy uses vasprintf(). This is a GNU extension that is also
   implemented in the BSDs.

 * Mooproxy uses getopt_long(). This is a GNU extension that is also
   implemented in the BSDs.

 * Mooproxy uses getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() for address family
   independent networking. These functions are defined in POSIX, but they're
   fairly recent additions, which could lead to problems on older OSes.

 * On systems with IPv6, mooproxy works best if the (pretty recent)
   IPV6_V6ONLY socket option is available, but this is not required.

 * Mooproxy uses crypt(), and expects it to support MD5 hashing.
   crypt() is defined in POSIX, but MD5 hashing is a GNU extension that is
   also implemented in the BSDs.

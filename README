Mooproxy, a buffering proxy for moo-connections.
Copyright (C) 2002 Marcel L. Moreaux <marcelm@luon.net>


Mooproxy is a layer between your MOO client and a MOO proxy, as shown below:

MOO client  <---->  Mooproxy  <---->  MOO server

The intention is that the proxy remains connected to the server, even if
you disconnect your client (because you shutdown/suspend your computer),
or become disconnected because of bad network, etc. It will also provide
features like centralised logging, which is useful if you connect with
different clients.

Mooproxy is still pretty basic; many features (such as logging and MCP
support) are lacking, but it is usable. It is still under development;
bug reports and suggestions are appreciated. If you really want to help,
run it with `` valgrind --leak-check=yes ./mooproxy '' in the source
directory, and report the full output of valgrind (and the mooproxy
version you're running) if it crashes or detects memleaks.

To compile mooproxy, simply type `` make '' in the source directory.
You need a working C compiler, and the development libraries for libc.

Running mooproxy is simple, just do `` ./mooproxy -w <wld> '', where <wld>
is the name of the world. Mooproxy will use the configuration file
~/.mooproxy/worlds/<wld> . See the file ExampleConfig for an example
configuration file.

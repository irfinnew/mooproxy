  1. About
  --------

Mooproxy is a layer between your MOO client and a MOO server, as shown below:

    MOO client  <---->  Mooproxy  <---->  MOO server

The intention is that the proxy remains connected to the server, even if
you disconnect your MOO client, for example, if you shutdown your computer,
take your laptop to a different place, or have network problems.

Mooproxy also provides centralised logging, which is useful if you use
multiple MOO clients.

Mooproxy is still under development; bug reports and other feedback is
appreciated. If you really want to help, run it in valgrind (with 
--leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes), and report any crashes or
memleaks you get (Please report the full valgrind output, and the version
of mooproxy you're using).

gdb backtraces of crashes are also helpful.



  2. Manual compiling and installing
  ----------------------------------

First, you can edit the Makefile to change some options (like installation
path and compiler flags), if you want to.

Next, to compile mooproxy, simply run

    make

in the source directory. You need a working C compiler, and the development
libraries for libc. Mooproxy also uses some functionality that may not be
present on all Unices; see Portability.

You can install by running

   make install

This will install the mooproxy binary (by default in /usr/local/bin), and
the manpage (by default in /usr/local/share/man/man1).
Alternatively, you can install by simply copying the mooproxy executable
to a suitable place, such as /usr/local/bin or ~/bin. Mooproxy requires no
other files (except configuration files) to run.




  3. Installing the Debian package
  --------------------------------

Currently, an i386 Debian package is provided. You can install it with

  dpkg -i mooproxy_<version>.deb



  4. Creating a Debian package
  ----------------------------

You can create your own Debian package as well (for another architecture,
for example). Follow the following steps:

  - Download mooproxy-debsrc-<version>.tar.gz
  - Unpack it somewhere
  - cd into mooproxy-<version>
  - Unpack mooproxy_<version>.orig.tar.gz
  - Run zcat mooproxy_<version>.diff.gz | patch -p0
  - cd into mooproxy-<version>
  - Run dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -rfakeroot

The Debian package (and some other files) will be generated in the top-level
mooproxy-<version> directory.



  5. Using
  --------

Running mooproxy is simple, just invoke it like this:

    mooproxy -w <wld>

where <wld> is the name of the world. Mooproxy will use the configuration
file ~/.mooproxy/worlds/<wld> . See the file ExampleConfig for an example
configuration file. The ExampleConfig file contains all configurable
options, and the settings in ExampleConfig are exactly the same as the
builtin defaults in mooproxy.

Mooproxy accepts commands to change a lot of its behaviour run-time.
When connected to mooproxy, do /help for a brief list of commands.



  6. Authentication
  -----------------

There are two situations in mooproxy that require authentication;

  - A MOO client connects to mooproxy
  - Mooproxy connects to a MOO server

Mooproxy uses the same authentication string for both. In the configuration
file for the world, you should put a MD5 hash of the authentication string.
When the client connects to mooproxy, the client or the user supplies the
authentication string to mooproxy. Mooproxy hashes the authentication
string from the client, compares it to the stored MD5 hash, and if they
match, the client is accepted.

At this point, mooproxy stores the _literal_ authentication string received
from the client in its memory. When mooproxy logs in to the server (for
example, because autologin is enabled), mooproxy uses this literal
authentication string to authenticate itself to the MOO server.

The MD5 hash can be created with the following command:

    mooproxy --md5crypt


An example scenario. Assume:

    The MOO server expects:     connect <username> <password>
    Your MOO client generates:  connect Gandalf Shire

Now, run the following command:

    mooproxy --md5crypt

When mooproxy asks for your authentication string (it will ask twice, to
save you from typos), you should enter:

    connect Gandalf Shire

Mooproxy will print a MD5 hash of the string, e.g.:

    $1$DWuIlrlu$vjiUiV7i23jNMCpSkDzDz.

You put this string in your configuration file, like so:

    auth_hash = "$1$DWuIlrlu$vjiUiV7i23jNMCpSkDzDz."

Now, when your client connects to mooproxy, it is prompted for the
authentication string. If your client responds with:

    connect Gandalf Shire

Mooproxy will accept the client, and store "connect Gandalf Shire" in its
memory. Now, when mooproxy connects to the MOO server, and autologin is
enabled, mooproxy sends the saved string, namely

    connect Gandalf Shire

to the MOO server, logging you in, just like your MOO client would without
mooproxy in the middle.


To change the authentication string from within mooproxy, you must also
provide the old literal authentication string, like this:

    /set auth_hash <new hash> <old literal>

So, continuing the example scenario above, if you change your password to
"Mirkwood", you must run mooproxy --md5crypt to generate a MD5 hash of the
new authentication string:

    $ mooproxy --md5crypt
    Authentication string: connect Gandalf Mirkwood
    MD5 hash: $1$PzGmXA.I$qmZomnNK2gBW6tR8iTJLA/

You can then set the new hash like this:

    /set auth_hash $1$PzGmXA.I$qmZomnNK2gBW6tR8iTJLA/ "connect Gandalf Shire"

The MD5 hash should _not_ be enclosed in quotes. It is recommended to enclose
the old literal in quotes, to remove ambiguity. After changing auth_hash
from within mooproxy, mooproxy no longer has a literal authentication string.
Therefore, autologin will not work until you re-authenticate to mooproxy
(for example, by disconnecting your client, and connecting again).



  7. MCP
  ------

Moo servers and clients may use the MOO Client Protocol (MCP) to exchange
some information out-of-band. Common uses include periodically showing a
tip or something else in a status bar, or maintaining a userlist on the
client. For more information, see http://www.moo.mud.org/mcp/index.html .

MCP is a stateful protocol; it has to be initialised and maintained properly.
When a MOO client connects to the MOO server, it expects to setup a MCP
session. Consider the following scenario:

 - Mooproxy is started
 - The client connects to mooproxy
 - Mooproxy connects to the MOO server
 - The MOO server sends MCP handshake. The client replies, and a MCP session
   is set up. Mooprox relays all MCP messages.
 - The client disconnects
 - The client connects again

Now, from the perspective of the MOO server, a MCP session still exists,
but the client cannot continue this old session (due to a lack of information
on the client). So the MCP session needs to be torn down and rebuilt.

Because Standard MCP doesn't provide a mechanism to re-initialise the MCP
session, a MCP package has been created for this purpose. The package is
called dns-nl-icecrew-mcpreset. More information can be found in
mcpreset.html .

Mooproxy uses the server MCP reset. When a client connects to mooproxy,
and mooproxy is already connected to a MOO server, mooproxy sends a MCP
reset command to the MOO server:

  #$#dns-nl-icecrew-mcpreset-reset <mcpkey>

When the MOO server receives this message, it should terminate the current
MCP session for the client, and start a new one by sending the MCP handshake.
Mooproxy then relays this handshake to the newly connected client, which
will respond, and a new MCP session will be set up.

If working MCP is desired, mooproxy can only be used with MOO servers that
support dns-nl-icecrew-mcpreset-reset.



  8. /recall
  ----------

In mooproxy 0.1.3, the recall command has received a significant update.
If you invoke the recall command with just a number, it will recall that
number of lines in their full glory, just like before:

   /recall 50

But now recall supports the following syntax as well:

   /recall [from <timespec>] [to <timespec>] [search <text>]

This will recall any lines matching <text> in the period from <from timespec>
to <to timespec>.

A timespec is one or more of the following:

   now
      Sets the time to the current date and time.
   today
      Sets the time to 0:00 today.
   yesterday
      Sets the time to 0:00 yesterday.
   last/next monday/tuesday/...
      Next <weekday> sets the time to 0:00 of the first <weekday> from today.
      Last <weekday> sets it to 0:00 of the last <weekday> before today.
   [YY/]MM/DD
      Set the time to 0:00 of the given day.
      If no year is specified, use MM/DD within the current year.
   HH:MM[:SS]
      Set the time to HH:MM within the current day.
      If seconds are not specified, set them to 00.
   -/+ <number> seconds/minutes/hours/days
      Change the time to be <number> <units> earlier or later.
   -/+ <number> lines
      Search in <number> lines before/after <from timespec>.

Notes:

   * Lines are recalled with their colours stripped.
   * -/+ <number> lines is special. It can only be used together with 'to',
     and when used, it must be the only timespec.
   * If both from and to are used, from must appear before to.
   * If search is used, it must be the last keyword.
   * The search keyword is case insensitive. It also treats <text> as a very
     primitive regular expression, which _only_ supports . (matches any
     character) and .* (matches zero or more any characters).
   * Weekdays support the usual abbreviations (mon, tue, wed, ...).
   * The units in relative timespecs can be abbreviated too (down to individual
     characters). +2 minutes, +2 mins, +2 min, +2 m are all equivalent.
   * The spacing in -/+ <number> <unit> is optional. + 2 min, +2 min, +2min
     are all equivalent.

Examples. Assume the current date and time are Wed Aug 22, 20:42:11.

   /recall from 10:00 to 11:00
     Recall all lines between 10:00:00 and 11:00:00 today.
   /recall from yesterday 10:00 to 11:00
     Recall all lines from 10:00 to 11:00 yesterday.
   /recall from -30 mins search yes.*play
     Search the last half hour for any lines containing "yes" before "play".
   /recall from 10:00 to +50 lines
     Recall 50 lines after 10:00:00 today.
   /recall to -80 lines
     Recall the last 80 lines.
   /recall from last monday to today.
     Recall everything from Mon 20/08 00:00 to Wed 22/08 00:00.
   /recall from last saturday to next monday
     Recall everything from Sat 18/08 00:00 to Mon 20/08 00:00.
   /recall from 04/22 next wed 11:35 to +1 hour
     Recall from 11:35 to 12:35 the wednesday after 22/04 (a sunday)

When you invoke recall, it will first report what it is going to recall, so
you can check if recall will actually inspect the lines you intended it to
inspect:

   % Recalling from Wed 2007/04/25 11:35:00 to Wed 2007/04/25 12:35:00.

Then it will produce the matching lines, with all colours stripped.
Finally, it will report how many lines it considered:

   % Recall end (X / Y / Z).

Here, X is the number of lines mooproxy has in its history. Y is the number
of lines that matched the time criteria (i.e. from and to). Finally, Z is the
number of lines actually recalled (i.e. that matched the time criteria and
search criteria).



  9. Logfiles change from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2
  --------------------------------------

In mooproxy 0.1.2, the logging was changed to log into a nested hierarchy
of directories, instead of all files in a single directory.

Mooproxy versions older than 0.1.2 log like this:

  logs
  |-- world one - 2007-01-01.log
  |-- world one - 2007-02-01.log
  |-- world two - 2007-02-01.log
  |-- world two - 2007-03-01.log
  |-- world two - 2007-03-02.log
  `-- world two - 2007-03-03.log

Mooproxy 0.1.2 and later log like this:

  logs
  |-- world one
  |   |-- 2007-01
  |   |   `-- world one - 2007-01-01.log
  |   `-- 2007-02
  |       `-- world one - 2007-02-01.log
  `-- world two
      |-- 2007-02
      |   `-- world two - 2007-02-01.log
      `-- 2007-03
          |-- world two - 2007-03-01.log
          |-- world two - 2007-03-02.log
          `-- world two - 2007-03-03.log

To move any existing logs from the old layout to the new layout,
use the update-logs.sh that's provided with mooproxy 0.1.2 (in the Debian
package, the shell script resides in /usr/share/doc/mooproxy).

Please make a backup of your current logfiles before running this script.



  10. Portability
  ---------------

Mooproxy is designed to run on modern Unices, most notably GNU/Linux and
the open source BSD variants. Mooproxy is written in ANSI C, using mostly
POSIX-defined systemcalls. This section documents the additional requirements
for mooproxy.

As of this writing, mooproxy is tested on Debian Unstable with Linux 2.6.

Portability pitfalls:

 * Mooproxy uses vasprintf(). This is a GNU extension that is also
   implemented in the BSDs.

 * Mooproxy uses getopt_long(). This is a GNU extension that is also
   implemented in the BSDs.

 * Mooproxy uses getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() for address family
   independent networking. These functions are defined in POSIX, but they're
   fairly recent additions, which could lead to problems on older OSes.

 * On systems with IPv6, mooproxy works best if the (pretty recent)
   IPV6_V6ONLY socket option is available, but this is not required.

 * Mooproxy uses crypt(), and expects it to support MD5 hashing.
   crypt() is defined in POSIX, but MD5 hashing is a GNU extension that is
   also implemented in the BSDs.

 * Mooproxy uses the S_ISLNK() macro, which is mandated in POSIX POSIX.1-2001
   but not in earlier versions.

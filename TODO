Probably's:
 * Implement autoreconnect (but not too hammering)
 * Make mooproxy close the current port, and bind to the new one if listenport is changed ?
 * Access / recall logs from within mooproxy? [from: paul]
 * Option for verbose MCP, to ease MCP weirdness debugging?
 * Improve /help, allow /help <cmd>.
 * Improve /listopts output.
 * Provide more and better documentation.
 * Add option to use different dir (instead of ~/.mooproxy) for configuration ?
 * Make mooproxy send MCP to the server setting the linelength to 80 if the connecting client is not MCP capable [from: bram]
 * Throttle client read() when server_txqueue is too full. (and vice versa)
 * Remove ASCII bell from history lines?


Maybe's:
 * Option to force IPv4 or IPv6? [from: bram]
 * Config file reloading on the fly? [from: cipri]
 * Support to listen on specific interfaces or addresses? [from: cipri]
 * Remove OOM detection in xmalloc() etc ? [Under Linux, the process seems to get SIGKILLed anyway]
 * Add logging framework which logs to file if mooproxy is running as daemon ?
 * Fix panic.c not to use sprintf()?
 * Add option to ignore lockfile ?
 * Implement some MCP userlist in mooproxy?
 * Make prefixes for infomessages and checkpoint messages different?
 * Print date/time on mooproxy messages?
 * Add SSL support (both ways)?
 * Latency tunen met TCP_NODELAY ?
 * Offer option for keeping logfiles synchronised to disk? (fdatasync())


Probably not's:
 * Disallow the proxy to connect to itself (how?)?  [seems impossible to do in a sane way]
 * Have mooproxy convert received text to the right charset for logging?  [too complex; mooproxy can't know the charsets]
 * The accessor functions are mostly just dumb wrappers. Can't this be done using less code?  [probably not worth the effort]
 * Commandstring escaping (to be able to send something starting with the cmdstring to the MOO)? [little enthusiasm from users]
 * Allow /recall to match timestamps and/or strings? [apparantly little enthusiasm from users]

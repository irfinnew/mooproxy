* Fix wat FIXME's

* Rewrite the MCP code, please.
* Better MCP key
* Catch MCP (and other?) failures?


Probably's:
 * Add 'connection taken over from' ?
 * Double commandstring is escape? E.g, if commandstring is '/', sending '//something' will send '/something' to the moo.
 * Symlink today -> <todays logfile> ? Yesterday -> <yesterdays logfile>?
 * Improve /help, allow /help <cmd>.
 * Allow special sequences in infostring that will be replaced with ANSI (eg %[red] -> ^]]1m)
 * Make /listopts fill 80 chars minus length of infostring (ignoring ANSI sequences!)
 * Implement autoreconnect (but not too hammering)
 * Add option for timestamping lines in logfiles ? [from: bram]
 * Allow /recall to do timestamp based selection ? [from: admar?]
 * Make mooproxy provide more context lines if the connection to client was lost, not closed ? [from: paul?]
 * Make some heuristics (possibly time-based) to calculate the amount of context lines to give ?
 * Allow /recall to recall last x lines that match a certain string (or regexp) ? [from: bram]
 * Provide more and better documentation.
 * Limit the amount of memory spent on log buffer if mooproxy cannot write to disk
 * Add option to ignore lockfile ?
 * Add option to use different dir (than ~/.mooproxy) for configuration ?
 * Make mooproxy send MCP to the server setting the linelength to 80 if the connecting client is not MCP capable [from: bram]
 * Log into a structured tree of directories (e.g. logs/world/month/world - date.log) ?
 * Make mooproxy close the current port, and bind to the new one if listenport is changed ?


Maybe's:
 * Support connect from a specific IP (for machines that have multiple IPs)? [from: cipri]
 * Config file reloading on the fly? [from: cipri]
 * Support to listen on specific interfaces or addresses? [from: cipri]
 * Remove OOM detection in xmalloc() etc ? [Under Linux, the process seems to get SIGKILLed anyway]
 * Add logging framework which logs to file if mooproxy is running as daemon ?
 * Fix panic.c not to use sprintf()?
 * Implement some MCP userlist in mooproxy?
 * Make prefixes for infomessages and checkpoint messages different?
 * Print date/time on mooproxy messages?
 * Add SSL support (both ways)?
 * Set socket options to make proxy-client connections time out more quickly? The sooner mpxy knows the connection is dead, the less data is lost.
 * Option for verbose MCP, to ease MCP weirdness debugging?
 * Latency tunen met TCP_NODELAY ?


Probably not's:
 * Disallow the proxy to connect to itself (how?)?  [seems impossible to do in a sane way]
 * Have mooproxy convert received text to the right charset for logging?  [too complex; mooproxy can't know the charsets]
 * The accessor functions are mostly just dumb wrappers. Can't this be done using less code?  [probably not worth the effort]

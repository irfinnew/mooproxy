* Rewrite the MCP code, please.
* Allow special sequences in infostring that will be replaced with ANSI (eg %[red] -> ^]]1m)?
* Make /listopts fill 80 chars minus length of infostring (ignoring ANSI sequences!)
* Make mooproxy refuse shutdown if there are unlogged lines. Add override too
* Log into a structured tree of directories (e.g. logs/world/month/world - date.log)?
* Make mooproxy a real daemon (add option to stay in foreground).
* Add logging framework which logs to file if mooproxy is running as daemon.
* The accessor functions are mostly just dumb wrappers. Can't this be done using less code?
* Add option for timestamping lines in logfiles?
* Have mooproxy convert received text to the right charset for logging?
* Make mooproxy close the current port, and bind to the new one if listenport is changed?
* Make prefixes for infomessages and checkpoint messages different?
* Allow /recall to do timestamp based selection?
* Make mooproxy provide more context lines if the connection to client was lost, not closed?
* Make some heuristics (possibly time-based) to calculate the amount of context lines to give?
* Print date/time on mooproxy messages?
* Allow /recall to recall last x lines that match a certain string (or regexp)?
* Improve /help, allow /help <cmd>.
* Disallow the proxy to connect to itself (how?)?
* Implement autoreconnect?
* Set socket options to make proxy-client connections time out more quickly? The quicker mooproxy knows the connection is dead, the less lines will be sent into the void.
* Provide more and better documentation.
* Implement some MCP userlist in mooproxy?
* Add SSL support (both ways)?

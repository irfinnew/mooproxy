* Use alarm signal for timing purposes?
* Make callback functions for server/client connect/disconnect.
* Make select() check for writable FD's if there's congestion
* Merge multiple lines in one write()
* Notify client if there are new lines and pass is off
* Print context-lines on connect?
* Logging
* Make resolve and connect() non-blocking
* IPv6 support
* Limit number of certain messages per <time>
* /stats: running time, servconn time, clientconn time, totallines, lines since
* Timeout on authenticating connections
* When connection is taken over, print the address of overtaking client ?
* At connect, print "last connected from <addr> at <time> ?


* /escape or /quote command?
* Disallow the proxy to connect to itself
* client connect/disconnect hook? Server connect hook?
* SSL support
* MCP userlist in mooproxy
* Multiple connections to one daemon ?
* Multiple worlds with one daemon ?
* MD5 hash support for password
* Connection logging (also to stdout if not daemon)
* Global 'master' config ?
* Autoreconnect
* Idle-protection
* Option: strict-cmd
* Day rollover
* Timestamping
* Daemonize (with option to stay on foreground)
* Better help, /help <cmd> etc
* Perhaps it's possible to set socket options to make proxy-client connections
  time out more quickly. The quicker the proxy knows the connection is dead,
  the less lines will be sent into the void.
* Prefix information from mooproxy with date/time?
* Log compression?

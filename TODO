Items considered for next release:
 * Make mooproxy send MCP to the server setting the linelength to 80 if the connecting client is not MCP capable [from: bram]
 * More features for /recall (non-re, case sensitive, count, limit, etc)
 * Better RE support for /recall
 * Throttle client read() when server_txqueue is too full. (and vice versa)
 * /lock command to disallow changing options / connecting to strange servers?
 * Fix some FIXMEs.
 * Live migration...?
 * Document autoreconnect behaviour
 * Delay on authentication failure?
 * Fix /recall to -10 lines
 * A command to send non-activating input to the MOO server.
 * Rename some options?
 * Improve setting of auth_md5hash.
 * Change authstring to just mean the password instead of the entire connection string. May require additional options...
 * Fix the remaining command/setting descriptions.
 * Fix the "wacko resolver slave after libc upgrade" bug.
 

Probably's:
 * /idle command (shows how long since you've last sent something to the moo)
 * Access / recall logs from within mooproxy? [from: paul]
 * Option for verbose MCP, to ease MCP weirdness debugging?
 * Provide more and better documentation.
 * Remove some trivial helper functions from accessor.c?
 * Make mooproxy not remember authstring if autologin is off. ?
 * Have ACE send MCP client-size messages?
 * Test ACE with konsole, Windows' cmd, putty. Working so far: Linux console, gnome-terminal, xterm, rxvt.
 * Add ACE to README?


Maybe's:
 * Option to force IPv4 or IPv6? [from: bram]
 * Config file reloading on the fly? [from: cipri]
 * Support to listen on specific interfaces or addresses? [from: cipri]
 * Remove OOM detection in xmalloc() etc ? [Under Linux, the process seems to get SIGKILLed anyway]
 * Add logging framework which logs to file if mooproxy is running as daemon ?
 * Fix panic.c not to use sprintf()?
 * Implement some MCP userlist in mooproxy?
 * Print date/time on mooproxy messages? Maybe define a %-sequence for date/time?
 * Add SSL support (both ways)?
 * Tune Latency with TCP_NODELAY ?
 * Add option to /connect to enable autoreconnect from the start?
 * Put program name and version in pre-authentication welcome message?


Probably not's:
 * Disallow the proxy to connect to itself (how?)?
   - Seems impossible to do in a sane way.
 * Have mooproxy convert received text to the right charset for logging?
   - Too complex; mooproxy can't know the charsets.
 * The accessor functions are mostly just dumb wrappers. Can't this be done using less code?
   - Lots of effort, (virtually) no gain.
 * Commandstring escaping (to be able to send something starting with the cmdstring to the MOO)?
   - Little enthusiasm from users.
 * Add option to use different dir (instead of ~/.mooproxy) for configuration ?
   - Little point.
 * Add option to ignore lockfile ?
   - Little point. The lockfile can always be removed if necessary.

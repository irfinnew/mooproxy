* Licentie veranderen naar GPL 2.0 specifiek?
* Do newlines the right way (tm)
* Merge multiple lines in one write()
* Delimiters before/by recall and/or pass
* Split up messages in "info" messages and "checkpoint" msgs
* Errorchecking on logging; improve logging robustness in general (time checkpoint)
* Timestamp lines, and allow timestamp-based recall ?
* More context lines on lost connection
* Print date on a lot of messages
* Delayed MCP
* Use alarm signal for timing purposes?
* Make select() check for writable FD's if there's congestion
* Make resolve and connect() non-blocking, also fix messaging
* IPv6 support
* Limit number of certain messages per <time>
* /stats: running time, servconn time, clientconn time, totallines, lines since
* Timeout on authenticating connections
* When connection is taken over, print the address of overtaking client ?
* At connect, print "last connected from <addr> at <time>" ?
* Better help, /help <cmd> etc
* Daemonize (with option to stay on foreground)
* Number of context lines depend on number of buffered lines waiting?
* Not a fixed number of context lines, but anything from the previous xxx minuts?


* Clean up function commentary / put variable names in function prototypes
* Is src in the aset_* and aget_* functions redundant?
* /escape or /quote command?
* Disallow the proxy to connect to itself
* client/server connect/disconnect hook?
* SSL support
* MCP userlist in mooproxy
* Multiple connections to one daemon ?
* Multiple worlds with one daemon ?
* Remember user and password (connectstring)
* MD5 hash support for password
* authstring-based encryption for connectstring?
* Connection logging (also to stdout if not daemon)
* Global 'master' config ?
* Autoreconnect
* Idle-protection ?
* Perhaps it's possible to set socket options to make proxy-client connections
  time out more quickly. The quicker the proxy knows the connection is dead,
  the less lines will be sent into the void.
* Log compression?
* Documentation!

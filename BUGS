 * Resolver slave can fail after libc upgrade.

   The forked child will inherit the libc of the parent process, but
   libnss_*.so are loaded dynamically, so their versions might not
   match the libc version mooproxy was started with.
   (reported: Bram Senders)

 * MCP can get into an inconsistent state (no known mcp key, no initmsg)

   I was able to get mooproxy in this state by reconnecting several
   times (some of which through daisy-chained mooproxy). Not sure
   how that caused the state to be messed up.

 * Mooproxy crashed when changing the system time.

   Can't reproduce. More info, ways to reproduce, backtraces etc
   are greatly appreciated.

 * Resolver slave can fail after libc upgrade.

   The forked child will inherit the libc of the parent process, but
   libnss_*.so are loaded dynamically, so their versions might not
   match the libc version mooproxy was started with.

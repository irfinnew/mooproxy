Description: A smart proxy for MUD/MOO connections
 Mooproxy is a smart proxy for MUDs/MOOs, a class of text-based RPGs.
 The MUD/MOO client connects to mooproxy, and mooproxy connects to the
 MUD/MOO server.
 .
 Mooproxy keeps you connected to the MUD/MOO server if the client
 disconnects (voluntarily, because of network problems, because the client
 crashes, because of a power outage, etc).
 .
 Mooproxy also provides centralised logging, buffers text when the client
 isn't connected, and provides context when the client does connect.

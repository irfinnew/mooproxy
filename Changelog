- autoreconnect setten vanuit user heeft nu onmiddelijk effect
- /get en /set weg, gebruik /option



01-09-2007  -  0.1.3
--------------------
 * /recall now allows users to search for specific lines by time and contents.
   See the README for details.
 * New option; autoreconnect will cause mooproxy to reconnect when it loses
   the connection to the server.
 * New option; newinfostring allows users to use a custom prefix for "New
   lines" and all related messages. This should make it easier to spot those
   lines when the client connects.
 * Setting the listenport option from within mooproxy is now allowed, and
   actually attempts to rebind to the new port.
 * Context lines produced when connecting now have the ASCII BELL character
   filtered from them, so you won't hear a sound from old lines.
 * Tab characters are now included in the logs instead of being discarded.
 * Improved logging performance.
 * Fixed a file descriptor leak on server hostname resolve.
 * Fixed a small bug that sometimes caused the timestamps in the logfiles to
   be off by one second.
 * Fixed a small bug where mooproxy would sometimes say "No new lines" instead
   of "End of new lines".


05-03-2007  -  0.1.2
--------------------
 * Context/history/new lines got a makeover. On connect, the user now gets
   context lines, possibly new lines, and certainly new lines.
 * max_buffered_size and max_history_size are replaced by max_buffer_size.
 * Logfiles are now stored in a hierarchy; logs/$worldname/YYYY-MM.
   Use the update-logs.sh script to update your logfiles' locations.
   Users of the Debian package can find the script in /usr/share/doc/mooproxy.
 * Mooproxy now requires colors in the infostring to be specified using
   mooproxy color sequences (see ExampleConfig for details).
 * Added timestamped_logs option, which prepends a timestamp to logged lines.
 * Added max_logbuffer_size option, to limit the amount of unlogged lines.
 * Mooproxy now creates 'today' and 'yesterday' logfile symlinks for each world.
 * Logfiles are now synced to disk every minute.
 * The logging error-checking has been improved.
 * Mooproxy now sends mcpreset to the client on server reconnect.
 * Mooproxy now checks ~/.mooproxy permissions and warns if they're weak.
 * The "Not connected to server" message is now throttled to once every 4 sec.



04-08-2006  -  0.1.1
--------------------
 * Fixed a bug where mooproxy won't start if ~/.mooproxy/locks/ doesn't exist.
 * Fixed a bug where mooproxy will crash if there's no auth_md5hash defined in
   the configuration file or the user does /set auth_md5hash "".
 * Fixed a bug where mooproxy did not save its PID in the pidfile if it was run
   in the foreground (instead of as a daemon).
 * Configuration loading code rewritten.
 * MCP code rewritten (less intrusive for non MCP capable clients now).
 * The maximum linelength has been increased from 16kb to 64kb
 * Improved the crashlog layout, and included a bit more information.
 * The README now contains a bit of information about MCP.
 * Cleaned up several parts of code, adding comments and improving efficiency
   or robustness in a few places.



16-02-2006  -  0.1.0
--------------------
 * Mooproxy is now also packaged as a Debian package
 * Mooproxy has become an actual daemon, backgrounding itself
 * New commandline option; -d forces mooproxy to stay on the foreground
 * Create and check for lockfiles, so only one instance can run for each world
 * SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGBUS are now caught
 * On crash, mooproxy creates a crash notice (~/mooproxy.crashed)
 * Mooproxy sends this crash notice to the client and to stderr as well
 * SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are now ignored
 * /shutdown now refuses to shut down if not all loggable data could be written
   to disk. -f overrides this



12-12-2005  -  0.0.7.1
----------------------
 * Fixed a bug where recalled lines would go in the history again, leading to
   duplicated lines in the history. Thanks to Admar Schoonen for reporting.



02-09-2005  -  0.0.7
--------------------
 * From now on, mooproxy is licensed under GPL 2, instead of "GPL 2 or later"
 * The README has gotten a major upgrade and now contains much more useful info
 * Server side now supports IPv6 (actually AF independant)
 * Client side now supports IPv6 (actually AF independant)
 * The authentication string is now MD5-hashed in the config file
 * Mooproxy accepts the --md5crypt option to generate a MD5 hash
 * /getopt and /setopt have been renamed to /get and /set
 * New option; autologin. Determines if the proxy logs in after connect
 * Logging has been improved further. On error conditions (such as lack of
   disk space), mooproxy now buffers loggable lines in memory, and writes
   them to log as soon as the error condition is resolved. The amount of
   memory mooproxy may use for this is not yet limited.
 * Multiple lines are now merged in one write(), improving throughput
 * Mooproxy now always emits network newlines (\r\n)
 * On connect, mooproxy now prints when and where from you were last connected
 * On connection takeover, mooproxy now reports the IP address of the overtaking
   client to the overtaken client.
 * The maximum authstring length has been reduced from 1024 to 128 bytes
 * The maximum linelength has been increased from 8kb to 16kb
 * Resolve of and connect to server are now nonblocking
 * /disconnect now aborts any resolving or connecting in progress
 * Mooproxy now checks every memory allocation, and aborts if one fails.
 * Mooproxy now returns EXIT_FAILURE or EXIT_SUCCESS, instead of
   the (undocumented) list of specific exit codes
 * Mooproxy now ignores SIGURG (used in OOB TCP, which we don't use anyway)
 * Cleaned up code comments, and added lots of new ones



19-07-2005  -  0.0.6.1
----------------------
 * Fixed SEGV on connect with no buffered lines waiting.
   Thanks to Bram Senders for reporting.



19-07-2005  -  0.0.6
--------------------
 * The infrastructure and main loop architecture have gotten a major overhaul
 * Regression; the output "resolving" and "connecting" steps of the /connect
   command now only get reported to the user simultaneously, after the process
   has completely succeeded or completely failed.
 * Mooproxy now automatically recalls and passes on connect
 * Removed command; /pass
 * New option; strict_commands. Determines what to do with invalid commands
 * New option; context_on_connect. The number of context lines you get
 * New option; max_buffered_size. The number of KB dedicated to buffer
 * New option; max_history_size. The number of KB dedicated to history
 * New option; logging_enabled. Determines if mooproxy logs.
 * Option parsing/management has been rewritten
 * Mooproxy now displays how full the buffer was in percent on connect
 * New command; /world. Prints the name of the current world
 * New command; /uptime. Reports starting date and running time
 * The output from /listopts is now limited to roughly 72 chars
 * The maximum linelength has been decreased from 100kb to 8kb
 * Mooproxy now ignores SIGHUP (so it continues running if parent dies)
 * MCP reset is now silent
 * Config dirs are now created with mode 700 instead of 750
 * Fixed bug in logging code. Extended ASCII chars are now logged too.



29-04-2004  -  0.0.5
--------------------
 * Forget MCP session on connect-to-server, so that MCP reset works properly
   if you disconnect and reconnect to the server.
 * Authentication code cleanup/rewrite. More efficient now.
 * If all authentication connections are full and there's a new connection,
   the oldest authentication connection gets kicked.
 * Removed commands; /time, /block, /options, /showopts
 * New commands for option management; /listopts, /getopt, /setopt
 * /connect now takes optional hostname and port
 * Improved /help
 * Day rollover notification (not generic, should be improved)
 * Logging (always on, output only, always without ansi, only 1 logfile/day.
   Functional, but generally hackish, rewrite)



19-04-2004  -  0.0.4
--------------------
 * Improved both read() and write() code. Much more robust now.
   The tradeoff is that simultaneously received lines are no longer
   merged into one write().
 * Fixed SEGV on resolve failure.
 * Fixed SEGV on authentication if no authstring is given in config.
 * Mooproxy now refuses to start if authstring is "" or absent.
 * MCP reset is now sent automatically on client connect.
   The /mcpreset command is removed.
 * History implemented. Use /recall <num> to recall num lines of history.
   Currently, mooproxy always keeps 1024 lines of history.
 * Added /version, which prints the mooproxy version.
 * Added /date, which prints the date/time. /time is an alias for /date.
 * Improved MCP parsing code. Much cleaner, and more robust.



15-04-2004  -  0.0.3
--------------------
 * Oops, 0.0.2 SEGVs if the client sends multilines to the server. That's
   fixed (well, workarounded... Improve the MCP code is on the Todo) now.



15-04-2004  -  0.0.2
--------------------
 * Prelimary MCP support. Mooproxy understands enough MCP to inject messages
   to the server stating it can do MCP resets.
 * New command; /mcpreset. Attempts to reset the MCP session. Use directly
   after your client connected to mooproxy (if mooproxy is connected to the
   server).
 * "disconnected" now goes in buffer and direct, meaning you will get the
   message twice (eventually).



01-04-2004  -  0.0.1
--------------------
 * First release; Basic functionality is there, but many features are lacking.
   You can connect to mooproxy, connect to the server, disconnect, reconnect,
   etc.



29-01-2004  -  None
-------------------
 * Resumed coding :)



27-03-2001  -  None
-------------------
 * started coding

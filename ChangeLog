19-07-2005  -  0.0.6.1
----------------------
* Fixed SEGV on connect with no buffered lines waiting.
  Thanks to Bram Senders for reporting.



19-07-2005  -  0.0.6
--------------------
* The infrastructure and main loop architecture have gotten a major overhaul
* Regression: the output "resolving" and "connecting" steps of the /connect
  command now only get reported to the user simultaneously, after the process
  has completely succeeded or completely failed.
* Mooproxy now automatically recalls and passes on connect
* Removed command: /pass
* New option: strict_commands. Determines what to do with invalid commands
* New option: context_on_connect. The number of context lines you get
* New option: max_buffered_size. The number of KB dedicated to buffer
* New option: max_history_size. The number of KB dedicated to history
* New option: logging_enabled. Determines if mooproxy logs.
* Option parsing/management has been rewritten
* Mooproxy now displays how full the buffer was in percent on connect
* New command: /world. Prints the name of the current world
* New command: /uptime. Reports starting date and running time
* The output from /listopts is now limited to roughly 72 chars
* The maximum linelength has been decreased from 100kb to 8kb
* Mooproxy now ignores SIGHUP (so it continues running if parent dies)
* MCP reset is now silent
* Config dirs are now created with mode 700 instead of 750
* Fixed bug in logging code. Extended ASCII chars are now logged too.



29-04-2004  -  0.0.5
--------------------
* Forget MCP session on connect-to-server, so that MCP reset works properly
  if you disconnect and reconnect to the server.
* Authentication code cleanup/rewrite. More efficient now.
* If all authentication connections are full and there's a new connection,
  the oldest authentication connection gets kicked.
* Removed commands: /time, /block, /options, /showopts
* New commands for option management: /listopts, /getopt, /setopt
* /connect now takes optional hostname and port
* Improved /help
* Day rollover notification (not generic, should be improved)
* Logging (always on, output only, always without ansi, only 1 logfile/day.
  Functional, but generally hackish, rewrite)



19-04-2004  -  0.0.4
--------------------
* Improved both read() and write() code. Much more robust now.
  The tradeoff is that simultaneously received lines are no longer
  merged into one write().
* Fixed SEGV on resolve failure.
* Fixed SEGV on authentication if no authstring is given in config.
* Mooproxy now refuses to start if authstring is "" or absent.
* MCP reset is now sent automatically on client connect.
  The /mcpreset command is removed.
* History implemented. Use /recall <num> to recall num lines of history.
  Currently, mooproxy always keeps 1024 lines of history.
* Added /version, which prints the mooproxy version.
* Added /date, which prints the date/time. /time is an alias for /date.
* Improved MCP parsing code. Much cleaner, and more robust.



15-04-2004  -  0.0.3
--------------------
* Oops, 0.0.2 SEGVs if the client sends multilines to the server. That's
  fixed (well, workarounded... Improve the MCP code is on the Todo) now.



15-04-2004  -  0.0.2
--------------------
* Prelimary MCP support. Mooproxy understands enough MCP to inject messages
  to the server stating it can do MCP resets.
* New command: /mcpreset. Attempts to reset the MCP session. Use directly
  after your client connected to mooproxy (if mooproxy is connected to the
  server).
* "disconnected" now goes in buffer and direct, meaning you will get the
  message twice (eventually).



01-04-2004  -  0.0.1
--------------------
First release; Basic functionality is there, but many features are lacking.
You can connect to mooproxy, connect to the server, disconnect, reconnect,
etc.



29-01-2004  -  None

--------------------
Prelimary MCP support. Mooproxy understands enough MCP to inject messages
to the server stating it can do MCP resets.

New command: /mcpreset. Attempts to reset the MCP session. Use directly
after your client connected to mooproxy (if mooproxy is connected to the
server).

"disconnected" now goes in buffer and direct, meaning you will get the
message twice (eventually).

--------------------
First release; Basic functionality is there, but many features are lacking.
You can connect to mooproxy, connect to the server, disconnect, reconnect,
etc.
